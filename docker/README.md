# Manta Docker

Local development services, run via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

**Not meant for production.** These compose files are for local dev only —
no restart policy (crashes should be visible, not silently healed), default
credentials, no backups/replication. Production deployment is a separate,
not-yet-addressed concern.

## Usage

```bash
docker compose --env-file ../backend/.env -f compose-dev-services.yaml up
```

Configuration (credentials, port) lives in [`backend/.env`](../backend/.env)
— the same file the backend app reads — not here, so there's one source of
truth instead of two.

## Testing

`compose-test-services.yaml` is used only by the backend's integration test
suite — see
[backend/tests/integration/conftest.py](../backend/tests/integration/conftest.py).
It `include`s `compose-dev-services.yaml` wholesale (every service, as-is) and
gives the stack its own Compose project name. Host ports are randomized via
[`.env.test`](.env.test), loaded on top of `backend/.env`, so a test run never
clashes with a locally running dev stack. You don't need to run any of this
yourself; `uv run pytest tests/integration` boots and tears it down
automatically.
