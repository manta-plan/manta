# Manta Backend

The Manta backend is built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
for dependency management. See the repo-level
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the architecture and coding standards
this package follows.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

## Running

```bash
uv run manta
```

## Linting & formatting

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for both linting and formatting.

```bash
uv run ruff check .     # lint
uv run ruff format .    # format
```

### Pre-commit hooks

A [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook runs Ruff automatically before
each commit and auto-fixes what it can. One-time setup, from anywhere in the
repo:

```bash
uv tool install pre-commit   # install the tool once, machine-wide
pre-commit install           # wire it up to this repo's git hooks
```
